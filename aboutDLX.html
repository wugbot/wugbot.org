<h2 id="digital">Isn't linguistics already digital? What is digital linguistics?</h2>

<p>No. We maintain that digital linguistics doesn't exist yet, and will not exist until we escape the print way of thinking about data. Moreover, the digital tools of linguistics are currently fractured. Each current piece of software is in itself helpful in various ways, but many of these programs are operating-system dependent, and generally only accomplish only a small portion of what the linguist needs to do. Our goal with Wugbot is not to fix this by making one application that can do <strong>everything</strong>, but rather to create the standards and the infrastructure so that the software programs that linguists build can speak to each other. In other words, we want to create an interface for documenting data, analyzing data, and archiving data. This interface will be able to pass data easily between different tools and, because we separate data from presentation, visualize that data in different ways.</p>

<p>Many linguists and computer scientists make a clear delineation between linguistics and computer science. We do not. Digital linguistics does not shy away from implementation issues, usability, or software development, because we recognize that these technologies are not different in principle from technologies like interlinear glossing or audio equipment, all of which form an integral part of the linguistic enterprise. These technology-related issues are not the focus of digital linguistics, but they must be dealt with adequately in order for the field of linguistics to progress successfully. Just as the documentary linguist is expected to understand some of the basic principles of audio formats and recording, we believe it is important that today's linguist have a basic understanding of data structure as it relates to the digital representation of data. We also feel that this is easy for any linguist to learn, and hope our tools can help teach linguists these skills.

<p>Thus we incorporate software development into the core goalset of the digital linguistics subfield. We encourage linguists and language workers to choose the level of technical proficiency they desire to have. Whatever that level is, the digitally-informed linguist has an important role to play in the goal of bringing digital technologies to linguistics. We value complaints, feedback, and ideas for improvement, because this is an integral part of the software development process, and how new technologies are created. We believe that progress in the field of digital linguistics should be evaluated in terms of how populizable the outputs of the field are, i.e. the extent to which the tools created with Wugbot's' methodology gain traction in the field of linguistics more broadly.</p>


<h2 id="theory">Digital Linguistics and Lingusitic Theory</h2>

<p>Digital linguistics forces linguists - and especially those creating the tools of digital linguistics - to think deeply and carefully about the objects of linguistics and the nature of linguistic data. A famous scientist once remarked, 'You can understand when you are able to quantify it', but the much-admired phonetician Peter Ladefoged quipped instead, 'You can understand a thing when you can write a computer program to represent it.' In our experience, this has often been the case. Learning how to represent linguistic data has gotten us to think about the basic concepts of linguistics in often new ways that yield insights into linguistic science, or what it is we're really doing when we represent certain things in print.</p>

<!-- I think this section will need to be cleaned up and explained in detail in layman's term. We'll also need to explain how Wugbot achieves these goals. I haven't read Bird and Simon 2003 yet, but I can get to this later.

<p>Using the web platform also meets many of the goals of the <a href="http://www.language-archives.org/documents/portability.pdf">Bird and Simons (2003)<a> model for portability:</p>

<ul>
<li>Content - terminology, accountability, richness</li>
<li>Format - openness, documentation, machine-readable, human-readable</li>
<li>Discovery - existence, relevance</li>
<li>Access - complete, unimpeded, universal</li>
<li>Citation - credit, provenance, persistence, immutability, components</li>
<li>Preservation - long-term, complete 1. Rights -documentation, research</li>
<li>Rights -documentation, research</li>
</ul>

We should also link Pat's MA thesis here.

<h2 id="why-web">Why the web?</h2>

<p>Wugbot uses the web as its platform. Ironically, this does not mean that everything we do is online. Rather, web technologies have become so robust that their applications now extend far beyond exchanging data across the internet. It is now possible to write a program that works in web browsers like Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome, Safari, etc., that never has to go online at all. These offline applications are ideal because anybody with a web browser can use them. They don't depend on whether you are running Windows, Mac, Android or Linux, and they don't depend on an internet connection. In short, the browser becomes the program.</p>

<p>At the same time, digital linguistics technologies can take advantage of data exchange across the web, allowing linguists to store their data on a server (only if they want), and contribute to massive cross-linguistic databases for linguistic research.</p>
