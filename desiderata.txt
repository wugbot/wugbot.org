Desiderata:
- display the total time of the text, and associated media
- when you click one tag, it delimits the list of tags to ones that co-occur
  - you can click a button to reset the tags, kinda like searching by department on Amazon
- render tags list with full abbreviation (currently doesn't have it)
- render text phrases without full abbreviation (current shows it)
- Somehow the notes in Helen's text got stored one letter to a text item - needs fixing!
- text updating is broken for the phrase - error happened when you tried editing the notes field on Helen's first text
- figure out why you've got an undefined start time in your Ekegusii stories
- also why your phonemic transcriptions aren't present in Helen's story
- ability to add/delete phrases to a text, and move them around (and change their time alignment without a waveform)
- close/open pane button isn't switch images (for the overview pane)
- Open overview pane when you switch to a different view
- Stop audio from double-playing in tagging view
- Custom fields (e.g. minPitch, maxPitch)
- Delete tags from a phrase on an individual level
- Ability to rename tags (combine add and delete process)
- Clicking any part of the phrase makes it selected
- Pressing tab when the tag popup is open shouldn't start playing the selected phrase
- Importing a text doesn't immediately add it to the corpus and rerender the texts list, but it should
- Ability to search within results
- Redisplay tagger after bulk tag
- Count of the number of items with each tag (overview view)
- Name of Add tag button in popup needs to change depending on whether you're adding or removing tags
- Tags overview list still isn't sorting correctly (you should just filter the tags into new arrays, and display only those arrays) in order
- Clicking on tag category renders all tags with that category (not just exact matches)
- Character palette
- Notes field on the tag
- Color field on tag
- Clicking the manage corpora box, then clicking outside of it, seems to reset the workview - stop this behavior
- Hide the results counter when the tagger module is hidden (it displays the last result when the user comes back to it)
- Ability to search for things that *don't* have a particular tag
- Pressing escape when a popup is open should close it
- Order the phrase-level tags alphabetically as well
- Ability to deselect all results
- Create .tagUp() and .tagDown() functions, to apply a tag at one level to every object at the level immediately above/below it
  - Maybe also a .moveTagDown() function, which moves a tag down a level to a specific, provided child
  - Also a .moveTagUp(), which moves a tag to its parent
- User icon should toggle the user popup, not just display it
- Add .selected highlighting to tags when clicked, and when ctrl+clicked (this probably means that the tagsOverview module shouldn't rerender for a new search - only when the corpus tag data changes)
- stick results / search bar at top
- a stats module
- the User popup should close when the user clicks the user icon a second time
- Ability to quickly go to a point in a text by breadcrumb
- Mark whether an example of something has been used in grammatical descriptions yet
- Click a tag or search result to see it in context, in the text
- List the text abbreviation in the search results (will need to get a textAbbrevs list to reference for each search result)
